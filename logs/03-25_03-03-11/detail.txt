Sentence: 'Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long [MASK] and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. '
Replace [MASK] with exactly one word. Only output the one word in \boxed{ }.

2025-03-25 03:05:07,271 - INFO - Okay, so I have this sentence where the [MASK] part is a word that I need to figure out. Let me read through the sentence again to understand what it's saying.

"Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long [MASK] and stops at a coffee shop afterwards."

Hmm, so the [MASK] is a place or an event. It's a noun, I think. The sentence is talking about Aya going somewhere, stopping at a coffee shop, and it's related to her walking speed and the time it takes.

Let me break down the sentence step by step.

First, she goes for a 9-kilometer-long [MASK]. So, she walks 9 kilometers somewhere, and that's where the [MASK] is. Then, she stops at a coffee shop afterwards.

The next part says, "When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, when her walking speed is s km/h, the time taken for the [MASK] is 4 hours, and out of that time, t minutes are spent in the coffee shop.

Then, it says, "When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, when her speed increases to s+2 km/h, the total time for the [MASK] is 2 hours and 24 minutes, but t minutes are still spent in the coffee shop.

Finally, the question is: "Suppose Aya walks at s+1/2 kilometers per hour. "

So, we need to figure out what [MASK] is, and then answer the question about the time it takes at s+1/2 km/h.

Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like this is a problem involving distance, speed, and time. The formula that relates these is:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time taken for the [MASK] is 9 kilometers divided by her speed.

But in the first scenario, when her speed is s km/h, the time taken is 4 hours. So, let's write that as an equation.

Time = Distance / Speed

So, 4 hours = 9 km / s km/h

Wait, that can't be right. If she walks 9 km at s km/h, the time should be 9

Sentence: 'Let $ABC$ be a [MASK] inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers.'

2025-03-25 03:06:58,848 - INFO - Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out what word goes in the place of [MASK]. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The sentence is: 'Let $ABC$ be a [MASK] inscribed in circle $\omega$. Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers.'

Alright, so the key here is to figure out what kind of triangle $ABC$ is. The sides are given as $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$. So, it's a triangle with sides 5, 9, and 10. Hmm, I wonder if it's a right-angled triangle or not. Let me check using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let's see, $5^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 81 = 106$, which is not equal to $10^2 = 100$. So, it's not a right-angled triangle. Maybe it's an acute or obtuse triangle. Let me calculate the angles using the Law of Cosines to see.

First, let's find angle at B. Using the Law of Cosines:

$\cos B = \frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 \cdot AB \cdot BC} = \frac{5^2 + 9^2 - 10^2}{2 \cdot 5 \cdot 9} = \frac{25 + 81 - 100}{90} = \frac{6}{90} = \frac{1}{15}$.

So, angle B is $\arccos(1/15)$. That's approximately 83 degrees. Since all angles are less than 90 degrees, the triangle is acute-angled.

Wait, but the problem mentions that triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\omega$. So, it's a circumscribed circle, meaning $\omega$ is the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. That makes sense.

Now,

Sentence: 'Each vertex of a regular [MASK] is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the [MASK] can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.'
