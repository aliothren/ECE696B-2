    "problem": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long [MASK] and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the [MASK] takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. ",
    "solution": "$\\frac{9}{s} + t = 4$ in hours and $\\frac{9}{s+2} + t = 2.4$ in hours.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get, \n$\\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6$\nMultiplying by $(s)(s+2)$, we get \n$9s+18-9s=18=1.6s^{2} + 3.2s$\nMultiplying by 5/2 on both sides, we get\n$0 = 4s^{2} + 8s - 45$\nFactoring gives us \n$(2s-5)(2s+9) = 0$, of which the solution we want is $s=2.5$.\nSubstituting this back to the first equation, we can find that $t = 0.4$ hours.\nLastly, $s + \\frac{1}{2} = 3$ kilometers per hour, so\n$\\frac{9}{3} + 0.4 = 3.4$ hours, or $\\framebox{204}$ minutes\n-Failure.net\nThe amount of hours spent while walking on the first travel is $\\frac{240-t}{6}$. Thus, we have the equation $(240-t)(s) = 540$, and by the same logic, the second equation yields $(144-t)(s+2) = 540$. We have $240s-st = 540$, and $288+144s-2t-st = 540$. We subtract the two equations to get $96s+2t-288 = 0$, so we have $48s+t = 144$, so $t = 144-48s$, and now we have $(96+48s)(s) = 540$. The numerator of $s$ must evenly divide 540, however, $s$ must be less than 3. We can guess that $s = 2.5$. Now, $2.5+0.5 = 3$. Taking $\\frac{9}{3} = 3$, we find that it will take three hours for the 9 kilometers to be traveled. The t minutes spent at the coffeeshop can be written as $144-48(2.5)$, so t = 24. $180 + 24 = 204$. -sepehr2010",

By the Three Tangents Lemma, we have that $MB$ and $MC$ are both tangents to $(ABC)$ $\\implies$ $M = D$, and since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{EF}$, $MF = MB$.

From the angle by tanget formula, we have $\\angle PBD = \\angle DAB$. Therefore by AA similarity, $\\triangle PBD \\sim \\triangle BAD$. Let $\\overline{BP} = x$. Using ratios, we have \\[\\frac{x}{5}=\\frac{BD}{AD}.\\] Similarly, using angle by tangent, we have $\\angle PCD = \\angle DAC$, and by AA similarity, $\\triangle CPD \\sim \\triangle ACD$.

    "solution": "Notice that the question's condition mandates all blues to go to reds, but reds do not necessarily have to go to blue. Let us do casework on how many blues there are. \nIf there are no blues whatsoever, there is only one case. This case is valid, as all of the (zero) blues have gone to reds. (One could also view it as: the location of all the blues now were not previously red.) Thus, we have $1$. \nIf there is a single blue somewhere, there are $8$ cases - where can the blue be? Each of these is valid. \nIf there are two blues, again, every case is valid, and there are $\\dbinom82=28$ cases. \nIf there are three blues, every case is again valid; there are $\\dbinom83=56$ such cases. \nThe case with four blues is trickier.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, $r\\geq{b} \\Longrightarrow b\\leq4$ if a configuration is valid.\nWe claim that if $b\\leq3$, then any configuration is valid. We attempt to prove by the following:\nIf there are \\[b\\in{0,1,2}\\] vertices, then intuitively any configuration is valid. For $b=3$, we do cases:\nIf all the vertices in $b$ are non-adjacent, then simply rotating once in any direction suffices. If there are $2$ adjacent vertices, then WLOG let us create a set $\\{b_1,b_2,r_1\\cdots\\}$ where the third $b_3$ is somewhere later in the set. If we assign the set as $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$ and $b_3\\leq4$, then intuitively, rotating it $4$ will suffice. If $b_3=5$, then rotating it by 2 will suffice. Consider any other $b_3>5$ as simply a mirror to a configuration of the cases.\nTherefore, if $b\\leq3$, then there are $\\sum_{i=0}^{3}{\\binom{8}{i}}=93$ ways. We do count the [i]degenerate[/i] case.\nNow if $b=4$, we do casework on the number of adjacent vertices.\n0 adjacent: $\\{b_1,r_1,b_2,r_2\\cdots{r_4}\\}$. There are 4 axes of symmetry so there are only $\\frac{8}{4}=2$ rotations of this configuration.\n1 adjacent: WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2\\cdots{b_3}\\cdots{b_4}\\}$ where $b_4\\neq{8}$. Listing out the cases and trying, we get that $b_3=4$ and $b_4=7$ is the only configuration. There are $8$ ways to choose $b_1$ and $b_2$ and the rest is set, so there are $8$ ways.\n2 adjacent: We can have WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2\\cdots{b_3},b_4\\}$ or $\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\cdots\\}$ where $b_4\\neq{8}$. The former yields the case $b_3=5$ and $b_4=6$ by simply rotating it 2 times. The latter yields none. There are 2 axes of symmetry so there are $\\frac{8}{2}=4$ configurations.\n3 adjacent: WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\cdots\\}$ which intuitively works. There are $8$ configurations here as $b_1$ can is unique.\nIn total, $b=4$ yields $2+8+4+8=22$ configurations.\nThere are $22+93=115$ configurations in total. There are $2^8=256$ total cases, so the probability is $\\frac{115}{256}$. Adding them up, we get $115+256=\\boxed{371}$.\n",

    "solution": "If we graph $4g(f(x))$, we see it forms a sawtooth graph that oscillates between $0$ and $1$ (for values of $x$ between $-1$ and $1$, which is true because the arguments are between $-1$ and $1$). Thus by precariously drawing the graph of the two functions in the square bounded by $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$, and hand-counting each of the intersections, we get $\\boxed{385}$\n\nNote\nWhile this solution might seem unreliable (it probably is), the only parts where counting the intersection might be tricky is near $(1,1)$. Make sure to count them as two points and not one, or you'll get $384$.\nWe will denote $h(x)=4g \\left( f \\left( x \\right) \\right)$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.\n\nWe notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0,\\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\\cdot24=384$ intersections.\n\nHowever, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\\boxed{385}$.\n~Xyco\nWe can easily see that only $x, y \\in \\left[0,1 \\right]$ may satisfy both functions.\nWe call function $y = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\sin \\left( 2 \\pi x \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 1 and function $x = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\cos \\left( 3 \\pi y \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 2.\nFor Function 1, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$, Function 1's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, $\\frac{i+1}{4}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1. \nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nFor Function 2, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{6} , \\frac{i+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 5 \\right\\}$, Function 2's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $y = \\frac{i}{6}$, $\\frac{i+1}{6}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1.\nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic curves.\nConsider any region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$.\nBoth functions have four monotonic pieces.\nBecause Function 1's each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ and Function 2' each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$, Function 1's each monotonic piece intersects with Function 2's each monotonic piece. \nTherefore, in the interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$, the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nNext, we prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $x = \\frac{i}{4}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 4 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nFor $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, Function 1 attains value 1. \nFor Function 2, if $y = 1$, then $x = 1$. \nTherefore, the intersecting point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nSimilarly, we can prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $y = \\frac{i}{6}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 6 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nTherefore, in each region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$, all 16 intersecting points are interior.\nThat is, no two regions share any common intersecting point.\nNext, we study region  $\\left[ \\frac{3}{4} , 1 \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{5}{6} , 1 \\right]$.\nConsider any pair of monotonic pieces, where one is from Function 1 and one is from Function 2, except the pair of two monotonic pieces from two functions that attain $\\left( 1 , 1 \\right)$.\nTwo pieces in each pair intersects at an interior point on the region.\nSo the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 - 1 = 15$.\nFinally, we compute the number intersection points of two functions' monotonic pieces that both attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nOne trivial intersection point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nNow, we study whether they intersect at another point.\nDefine $x = 1 - x'$ and $y = 1 - y'$.\nThus, for positive and sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, Function 1 is reduced to\n\\[ y' = 4 \\sin 2 \\pi x' \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\]\nand Function 2 is reduced to\n\\[ x' = 4 \\left( 1 - \\cos 3 \\pi y' \\right) . \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\]\nNow, we study whether there is a non-zero solution.\nBecause we consider sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, to get an intuition and quick estimate, we do approximations of the above equations.\nEquation (1) is approximated as\n\\[ y' = 4 \\cdot 2 \\pi x' \\]\nand Equation (2) is approximated as\n\\[ x' = 2 \\left( 3 \\pi y' \\right)^2  \\]\nTo solve these equations, we get $x' = \\frac{1}{8^2 \\cdot 18 \\pi^4}$ and $y' = \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 18 \\pi^3}$.\nTherefore, two functions' two monotonic pieces that attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$ have two intersecting points.\nPutting all analysis above, the total number of intersecting points is $16 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{385}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",

To be specific, $H$ and $D$ are on opposite sides of $BC$, $H$ and $C$ are on the same side of $BD$, and $H$ and $B$ are on the same side of $CD$. \nNow, we compute the volume of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, denoted as $V$.

Place $CD$ on the top vertex parallel to the ground with midpoint $M.$ Observe that $CD$ can rotate about its midpoint. At a certain angle, we observe that the lengths satisfy those given in the problem. If we project $AB$ onto the plane of $CD$, let the minor angle $\\theta$ be this discrepancy.\nBy Median formula or Stewart's theorem, $AM = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2AC^2 + 2AD^2 - CD^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2}.$ Consequently the area of $\\triangle AMB$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\left (\\sqrt{(\\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2})^2} \\right ) = 4\\sqrt{41}.$ Note the altitude $8$ is also the distance between the parallel planes containing $AB$ and $CD.$\nBy Distance Formula,\n\\begin{align*} (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AC^2 = 80 \\\\ (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AD^2 = 89 \\\\ \\implies CD \\cos{\\theta} \\sqrt{41} &= 9 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta} &= \\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{9}{41})^2} = \\frac{40}{41}. \\end{align*}\nThen the volume of the tetrahedron is given by $\\frac{1}{3} [AMB] \\cdot CD \\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{160}{3}.$\nThe volume of the tetrahedron can also be segmented into four smaller tetrahedrons from $I$ w.r.t each of the faces. If $r$ is the inradius, i.e the distance to the faces, then $\\frac{1}{3} r([ABC] + [ABD] + [ACD] + [BCD])$ must the volume. Each face has the same area by SSS congruence, and by Heron's it is $\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)(c + (a-b))(c -(a - b))} = 6\\sqrt{21}.$\nTherefore the answer is, $\\dfrac{3 \\frac{160}{3}}{24 \\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\implies \\boxed{104}.$\n~Aaryabhatta1",

We do a bunch of algebra: \n\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\dfrac{23}{a^2} \\\\\n27&=a^2+2aL \\\\\n&=a^2+2a\\left(\\dfrac{23}{a^2}\\right) \\\\\n&=a^2+\\dfrac{46}a \\\\\n27a&=a^3+46 \\\\\na^3-27a+46&=0. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem and test a few values. It turns out that $a=2$ works. We use synthetic division to divide by $a-2$: \n[Asdf.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Asdf.png)\nAs we expect, the remainder is $0$, and we are left with the polynomial $x^2+2x-23$. We can now simply use the quadratic formula and find that the remaining roots are $\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4(-23)}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{96}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm4\\sqrt6}{2}=-1\\pm2\\sqrt6$. We want the smallest $a$ to maximize $L$, and it turns out that $a=2$ is in fact the smallest root. Thus, we let $a=2$. Substituting this into $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$, we find that $L=\\dfrac{23}4$. However, this is not our answer! This is simply the length of the box; we want the radius of the sphere enclosing it. We know that the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box, and the 3D Pythagorean Theorem can give us the space diagonal. Applying it, we find that the diagonal has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2+\\left(\\dfrac{23}4\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{8+\\dfrac{529}{16}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{128+529}{16}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}4$. This is the diameter; we halve it to find the radius, $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}8$. We then square this and end up with $\\dfrac{657}{64}$, giving us an answer of $657+64=\\boxed{721}$.\n\n~Technodoggo\nAnother approach:\nConsider $x,y,z$ to be the edges. $xy=z, xyz=23,$ etc. Then do a Lagrange multiplier. The final $r=\\sqrt(\\dots).$ Indeed $r^2=657/64.$\nHence $721$.\n",

    "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following [MASK]. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the [MASK] regardless of Alice's play.",
    "solution": "Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{809}$\n~lprado\nWe will use winning and losing positions, where a $W$ marks when Alice wins and an $L$ marks when Bob wins.\n$1$ coin: $W$\n$2$ coins: $L$\n$3$ coins: $W$\n$4$ coins: $W$\n$5$ coins: $L$\n$6$ coin: $W$\n$7$ coins: $L$\n$8$ coins: $W$\n$9$ coins: $W$\n$10$ coins: $L$\n$11$ coin: $W$\n$12$ coins: $L$\n$13$ coins: $W$\n$14$ coins: $W$\n$15$ coins: $L$\nWe can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \\mod{5}$ and winning positions occur otherwise. In other words, there will be $2$ losing positions out of every $5$ consecutive values of n. As $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2020$, $\\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from $2021$ to $2024$, $2022$ is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020\\times\\frac{2}{5}+1=\\boxed{809}$\n~alexanderruan\nDenote by $A_i$ and $B_i$ Alice's or Bob's $i$th moves, respectively.\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$.\nCase 2: $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 3: $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 4$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 4: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nTherefore, after the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor$th turn, there are two tokens leftover.\nTherefore, Alice must take 1 in the next turn that leaves the last token on the table.\nTherefore, Bob can take the last token to win the game.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor +1 = 405$.\nCase 5: $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nConsider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nBy doing so, there will finally be 2 tokens on the table and Bob moves first. Because Bob has the only choice of taking 1 token, Alice can take the last token and win the game.\nTherefore, in this case, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nPutting all cases together, the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(809) }}$.\nSince the game Alice and Bob play is impartial (the only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first (note that games like chess are not impartial because each player can only move their own pieces)), we can use the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to solve this problem. We will use induction to calculate the Grundy Values for this game.\nWe claim that heaps of size congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{P}$ (win for player 2 = Bob), and heaps of size equivalent to $1,3,4 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{N}$ (win for player 1 = Alice). Note that the mex (minimal excludant) of a set of nonnegative integers is the least nonnegative integer not in the set. e.g. mex$(1, 2, 3) = 0$ and mex$(0, 1, 2, 4) = 3$.\n\n$\\text{heap}(0) = \\{\\} = *\\text{mex}(\\emptyset) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(1) = \\{0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(2) = \\{*\\} = *\\text{mex}(1) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(3) = \\{0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(4) = \\{0, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 1) = *2$\n\n$\\text{heap}(5) = \\{*, *2\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 2) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(6) = \\{0, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(7) = \\{*, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 1) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(8) = \\{*2, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 2) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(9) = \\{0, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 1) = *2$\n\n$\\text{heap}(10) = \\{*, *2\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 2) = 0$\n\nWe have proven the base case.

QED.\nThere are $2020*\\frac{2}{5}=808$ positive integers congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ between 1 and 2020, and 1 such integer between 2021 and 2024. $808 + 1 = \\boxed{809}$.\n\n~numerophile\nWe start with $n$ as some of the smaller values. After seeing the first 4 where Bob wins automatically, with trial and error we see that $2, 5, 7,$ and $10$ are spaced alternating in between 2 and 3 apart. This can also be proven with modular arithmetic, but  this is an easier solution for some people. We split them into 2 different sets with common difference 5: {2,7,12 ...} and {5,10,15...}.

Notice that we have a $-108b$ in the expression; to maximize the expression, we want $b$ to be negative so that $-108b$ is positive and thus contributes more to the expression.

We also know $|z|=4$ or $a^2+b^2=16$. We want to find the line $81a-108b=k$ tangent to circle $a^2+b^2=16$.\nUsing $\\frac{|ax+by+c|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=r$ we can substitute and get $\\frac{|81(0)-108(0)-k|}{\\sqrt{81^2+108^2}}=4$\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{18225}}&=4 \\\\\\frac{k}{135}&=4 \\\\k&=\\boxed{540} \\end{align*}\n~BH2019MV0\nFollow Solution 1 to get $81a-108b$. We can let $a=4\\cos\\theta$ and $b=4\\sin\\theta$ as $|z|=4$, and thus we have $324\\cos\\theta-432\\sin\\theta$. Furthermore, we can ignore the negative sign in front of the second term as we are dealing with sine and cosine, so we finally wish to maximize $324\\cos\\theta+432\\sin\\theta$ for obviously positive $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$.\n\nUsing the previous fact, we can use the [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cauchy-Schwarz_Inequality) to calculate the maximum.

To maximize this expression, we must maximize $3a-4b$. Let this value be $x$. Solving for $a$ yields $a=\\frac{x+4b}{3}$. From the given information we also know that $a^2+b^2=16$. Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$. Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$.

    "problem": "Let $[MASK] ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\\overline{IA}\\perp\\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$.",
    "solution": "Start off by (of course) drawing a diagram! Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenters of triangle $ABC$, respectively. Furthermore, extend $AI$ to meet $BC$ at $L$ and the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ at $D$.\n\n\nWe'll tackle the initial steps of the problem in two different manners, both leading us to the same final calculations.\nSince $I$ is the incenter, $\\angle BAL \\cong \\angle DAC$. Furthermore, $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ADC$ are both subtended by the same arc $AC$, so $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ADC.$ Therefore by AA similarity, $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle ADC$. \nFrom this we can say that \\[\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{AL}{AC} \\implies AB \\cdot AC = AL \\cdot AD\\]\nSince $AD$ is a chord of the circle and $OI$ is a perpendicular from the center to that chord, $OI$ must bisect $AD$. This can be seen by drawing $OD$ and recognizing that this creates two congruent right triangles. Therefore, \\[AD = 2 \\cdot ID \\implies AB \\cdot AC = 2 \\cdot AL \\cdot ID\\]\nWe have successfully represented $AB \\cdot AC$ in terms of $AL$ and $ID$. Solution 1.2 will explain an alternate method to get a similar relationship, and then we'll rejoin and finish off the solution.\n$\\angle ALB \\cong \\angle DLC$ by vertical angles and $\\angle LBA \\cong \\angle CDA$ because both are subtended by arc $AC$. Thus $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle CDL$.\nThus \\[\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{AL}{CL} \\implies AB = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL}\\]\nSymmetrically, we get $\\triangle ALC \\sim \\triangle BLD$, so\n\\[\\frac{AC}{BD} = \\frac{AL}{BL} \\implies AC = BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\nSubstituting, we  get \\[AB \\cdot AC = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL} \\cdot BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\nLemma 1: BD = CD = ID\nProof: \nWe commence angle chasing: we know $\\angle DBC \\cong DAC = \\gamma$. Therefore \\[\\angle IBD = \\alpha + \\gamma\\].\nLooking at triangle $ABI$, we see that $\\angle IBA = \\alpha$, and $\\angle BAI = \\gamma$. Therefore because the sum of the angles must be $180$, $\\angle BIA = 180-\\alpha - \\gamma$. Now $AD$ is a straight line, so \\[\\angle BID = 180-\\angle BIA = \\alpha+\\gamma\\].\nSince $\\angle IBD = \\angle BID$, triangle $IBD$ is isosceles and thus $ID = BD$. \nA similar argument should suffice to show $CD = ID$ by symmetry, so thus $ID = BD = CD$.\nNow we regroup and get \\[CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL} \\cdot BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL} = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL^2}{BL \\cdot CL}\\]\nNow note that $BL$ and $CL$ are part of the same chord in the circle, so we can use Power of a point to express their product differently. \\[BL \\cdot CL = AL \\cdot LD \\implies AB \\cdot AC = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL}{LD}\\]\nNow we have some sort of expression for $AB \\cdot AC$ in terms of $ID$ and $AL$. Let's try to find $AL$ first.\nDrop an altitude from $D$ to $BC$, $I$ to $AC$, and $I$ to $BC$:\n\nSince $\\angle DBE \\cong \\angle IAF$ and $\\angle BED \\cong \\angle IFA$, $\\triangle BDE \\sim \\triangle AIF$.\nFurthermore, we know $BD = ID$ and $AI = ID$, so $BD = AI$. Since we have two right similar triangles and the corresponding sides are equal, these two triangles are actually congruent: this implies that $DE = IF = 6$ since $IF$ is the inradius.\nNow notice that $\\triangle IGL \\sim \\triangle DEL$ because of equal vertical angles and right angles. Furthermore, $IG$ is the inradius so it's length is $6$, which equals the length of $DE$. Therefore these two triangles are congruent, so $IL = DL$.\nSince $IL+DL = ID$, $ID = 2 \\cdot IL$. Furthermore, $AL = AI + IL = ID + IL = 3 \\cdot IL$. \nWe can now plug back into our initial equations for $AB \\cdot AC$:\nFrom $1.1$, $AB \\cdot AC = 2 \\cdot AL \\cdot ID = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot IL \\cdot 2 \\cdot IL$\n\\[\\implies AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot IL) \\cdot (2 \\cdot IL) = 3 \\cdot ID^2\\]\nAlternatively, from $1.2$, $AB \\cdot AC = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL}{DL}$\n\\[\\implies AB \\cdot AC = ID^2  \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot IL}{IL} = 3 \\cdot ID^2\\]\nNow all we need to do is find $ID$.\nThe problem now becomes very simple if one knows Euler's Formula for the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle. This formula states that $OI^2 = R(R-2r)$, where $R$ is the circumradius and $r$ is the inradius. We will prove this formula first, but if you already know the proof, skip this part.\nTheorem: in any triangle, let $d$ be the distance from the circumcenter to the incenter of the triangle. Then $d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)$, where $R$ is the circumradius of the triangle and $r$ is the inradius of the triangle.\nProof:\nConstruct the following diagram:\n\n\n\nLet $OI = d$, $OH = R$, $IF = r$. By the Power of a Point, $IH \\cdot IJ = AI \\cdot ID$.\n$IH = R+d$ and $IJ = R-d$, so \\[(R+d) \\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot ID = AI \\cdot CD\\]\nNow consider $\\triangle ACD$. Since all three points lie on the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$, the two triangles have the same circumcircle. Thus we can apply law of sines and we get $\\frac{CD}{\\sin(\\angle DAC)} = 2R$. This implies\n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\sin(\\angle DAC)\\]\nAlso, $\\sin(\\angle DAC)) = \\sin(\\angle IAF))$, and $\\triangle IAF$ is right. Therefore \\[\\sin(\\angle IAF) = \\frac{IF}{AI} = \\frac{r}{AI}\\]\nPlugging in, we have \n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\frac{r}{AI} = 2R \\cdot r\\]\nThus \\[R^2-d^2 = 2R \\cdot r \\implies d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)\\]\n\n\nNow we can finish up our solution. We know that $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot ID^2$. Since $ID = AI$, $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2$. Since $\\triangle AOI$ is right, we can apply the pythagorean theorem: $AI^2 = AO^2-OI^2 = 13^2-OI^2$.\nPlugging in from Euler's formula, $OI^2 = 13 \\cdot (13 - 2 \\cdot 6) = 13$.\nThus $AI^2 = 169-13 = 156$.\nFinally $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2 = 3 \\cdot 156 = \\textbf{468}$.\n\n~KingRavi\nBy Euler's formula $OI^{2}=R(R-2r)$, we have $OI^{2}=13(13-12)=13$. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AI^{2}=13^{2}-13=156$. Let $AI\\cap(ABC)=M$; notice $\\triangle AOM$ is isosceles and $\\overline{OI}\\perp\\overline{AM}$ which is enough to imply that $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AM}$, and $M$ itself is the midpoint of $II_{a}$ where $I_{a}$ is the $A$-excenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Therefore, $AI=IM=MI_{a}=\\sqrt{156}$ and \\[AB\\cdot AC=AI\\cdot AI_{a}=3\\cdot AI^{2}=\\boxed{468}.\\]\nNote that this problem is extremely similar to [2019 CIME I/14](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2019_CIME_I_Problems/Problem_14).\nDenote $AB=a, AC=b, BC=c$. By the given condition, $\\frac{abc}{4A}=13; \\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=6$, where $A$ is the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$.\nMoreover, since $OI\\bot AI$, the second intersection of the line $AI$ and $(ABC)$ is the reflection of $A$ about $I$, denote that as $D$. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $DI=BD=CD=\\frac{AD}{2}\\implies BD(a+b)=2BD\\cdot c\\implies a+b=2c$.\nThus, we have $\\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=\\frac{2A}{3c}=6, A=9c$. Now, we have $\\frac{abc}{4A}=\\frac{abc}{36c}=\\frac{ab}{36}=13\\implies ab=\\boxed{468}$\n~Bluesoul\nDenote by $R$ and $r$ the circumradius and inradius, respectively.\nFirst, we have\n\\[\nr = 4 R \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2} \\hspace{1cm} (1)\n\\]\nSecond, because $AI \\perp IO$,\n\\begin{align*}\nAI & = AO \\cos \\angle IAO \\\\\n& = AO \\cos \\left( 90^\\circ - C - \\frac{A}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = AO \\sin \\left( C + \\frac{A}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = R \\sin \\left( C + \\frac{180^\\circ - B - C}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = R \\cos \\frac{B - C}{2} .\n\\end{align*}\nThus,\n\\begin{align*}\nr & = AI \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\\\\n& = R \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\n\\end{align*}\nTaking $(1) - (2)$, we get\n\\[\n4 \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2} = \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} .\n\\]\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2}\n& = - \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} + \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} .\n\\end{align*}\nPlugging this into the above equation, we get\n\\[\n\\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} = 2 \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} . \\hspace{1cm} (3)\n\\]\nNow, we analyze Equation (2). We have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{r}{R} & = \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} \\\\\n& = \\sin \\frac{180^\\circ - B - C}{2} \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} \\\\\n& = \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} \\hspace{1cm} (4)\n\\end{align*}\nSolving Equations (3) and (4), we get\n\\[\n\\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2R}}, \\hspace{1cm}\n\\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{R}} . \\hspace{1cm} (5)\n\\]\nNow, we compute $AB \\cdot AC$.

Complete the cube to get $-(a-100)^3-(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 9000000-30000(a+b+c)$, which so happens to be 0. Then we have $(a-100)^3+(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 0$.

Thus, $b + c = 200$.\nBecause $b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers and $b - 100 \\neq 0$ and $c - 100 \\neq 0$, the number of solutions is 200.\nFollowing from the rule of product, the number of solutions in this case is $3 \\cdot 200 = 600$.\nCase 2: At least two out of $a - 100$, $b - 100$, $c - 100$ are equal to 0.\nBecause $a + b + c = 300$, we must have $a = b = c = 100$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions in this case is 1.\nPutting all cases together, the total number of solutions is $600 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(601) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\nWe will use Vieta's formulas to solve this problem. We assume $a + b + c = 300$, $ab + bc + ca = m$, and $abc = n$. Thus $a$, $b$, $c$ are the three roots of a cubic polynomial $f(x)$.\nWe note that $300m = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=\\sum_{cyc} a^2b + 3abc = 6000000 + 3n$, which simplifies to $100m - 2000000 = n$.\nOur polynomial $f(x)$ is therefore equal to $x^3 - 300x^2 + mx - (100m - 2000000)$. Note that $f(100) = 0$, and by polynomial division we obtain $f(x) = (x - 100)(x^2 - 200x - (m-20000))$.\nWe now notice that the solutions to the quadratic equation above are $x = 100 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{200^2 - 4(m - 20000)}}{2} = 100 \\pm \\sqrt{90000 - 4m}$, and that by changing the value of $m$ we can let the roots of the equation be any pair of two integers which sum to $200$. Thus any triple in the form $(100, 100 - x, 100 + x)$ where $x$ is an integer between $0$ and $100$ satisfies the conditions.\nNow to count the possible solutions, we note that when $x \\ne 100$, the three roots are distinct; thus there are $3! = 6$ ways to order the three roots. As we can choose $x$ from $0$ to $99$, there are $100 \\cdot 3! = 600$ triples in this case. When $x = 100$, all three roots are equal to $100$, and there is only one triple in this case.\nIn total, there are thus $\\boxed{601}$ distinct triples.\n~GaloisTorrent <3\nLet's define $a=100+x$, $b=100+y$, $c=100+z$. Then we have $x+y+z=0$ and $6000000 = \\sum a^2(b+c)$\n$= \\sum (100+x)^2(200-x) = \\sum (10000+200x+x^2)(200-x) = \\sum (20000 - 10000 x + x(40000-x^2))$\n$= \\sum (20000 + 30000 x -x^3) = 6000000 - \\sum x^3$, so we get $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$. Then from $x+y+z = 0$, we can find $0 = x^3+y^3+z^3 = x^3+y^3-(x+y)^3 = 3xyz$, which means that one of $a$, $b$,$c$ must be 0. There are 201 solutions for each of $a=0$, $b=0$ and $c=0$, and subtract the overcounting of 2 for solution $(200, 200, 200)$, the final result is $201 \\times 3 - 2 = \\boxed{601}$.\nDan Li\n\ndan",

Since a, b, c, and d is the largest possible number between 0 to 9, we use casework to determine the answer is a=5, b=6, c=9, and d=4, which gives us an answer of $5+694=\\boxed{699}$\n~Callisto531 and his dad",

    "problem": "[MASK] $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. \n[asy] unitsize(0.3 inch); draw(ellipse((0,0), 3, 1.75)); draw((-1.2,0.1)..(-0.8,-0.03)..(-0.4,-0.11)..(0,-0.15)..(0.4,-0.11)..(0.8,-0.03)..(1.2,0.1)); draw((-1,0.04)..(-0.5,0.12)..(0,0.16)..(0.5,0.12)..(1,0.04)); draw((0,2.4)--(0,-0.15)); draw((0,-0.15)--(0,-1.75), dashed); draw((0,-1.75)--(0,-2.25)); draw(ellipse((2,0), 1, 0.9)); draw((2.03,-0.02)--(2.9,-0.4)); [/asy]",
    "solution": "First, let's consider a section $\\mathcal{P}$ of the solids, along the axis.\nBy some 3D-Geomerty thinking, we can simply know that the axis crosses the sphere center. So, that is saying, the $\\mathcal{P}$ we took crosses one of the equator of the sphere.\nHere I drew two graphs, the first one is the case when $T$ is internally tangent to $S$,\n\nand the second one is when $T$ is externally tangent to $S$.\n\nFor both graphs, point $O$ is the center of sphere $S$, and points $A$ and $B$ are the intersections of the sphere and the axis. Point $E$ (ignoring the subscripts) is one of the circle centers of the intersection of torus $T$ with section $\\mathcal{P}$. Point $G$ (again, ignoring the subscripts) is one of the tangents between the torus $T$ and sphere $S$ on section $\\mathcal{P}$. $EF\\bot CD$, $HG\\bot CD$.\nAnd then, we can start our calculation.\nIn both cases, we know $\\Delta OEF\\sim \\Delta OGH\\Longrightarrow \\frac{EF}{OE} =\\frac{GH}{OG}$.\nHence, in the case of internal tangent, $\\frac{E_iF_i}{OE_i} =\\frac{G_iH_i}{OG_i}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11-3} =\\frac{r_i}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_i=\\frac{33}{4}$.\nIn the case of external tangent, $\\frac{E_oF_o}{OE_o} =\\frac{G_oH_o}{OG_o}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11+3} =\\frac{r_o}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_o=\\frac{33}{7}$.\nThereby, $r_i-r_o=\\frac{33}{4}-\\frac{33}{7}=\\frac{99}{28}$.
